## About The Project

I wanted to put all my **creative** work in one place, and also make the process to **keep it up to date easier**. I also wanted to focus for once only and fully on the `Front-End` part of the website.

I also tried as my best to make the website fast and light, so that it can be accessible to everyone, keeping every files under 1MB.

### Markdown Parser üìÑ

The more I progressed in the development of this website, the more I realized that I needed a way to write my content in a more flexible way than HTML. This means that when I'm ready, I can concentrate on writing the content without having to worry about the layout.

After several iterations, I ended up writing my own Markdown Parser first in `Python`, then `Julia`. I chose Julia because it is a language that I wanted to learn, and it is also very fast.

Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/Eric-Philippe/JuliaMarkdownJoy)

> At the end, you can find all the markdown files in the `_projects` folder.

### DevPortfolio üíª

<img src="./res/dev_portfolio.png"
style="border-radius: 10px;">

This portfolio is a showcase of my work as a developer. It includes my projects, my skills, and my resume.

#### Projects üìÅ

The projects are written in markdown, and are located in the `_projects` folder. The parser will generate the content of the projects section from these files, during the CI/CD pipeline.

You can click on a project to see its details.

#### Skills üß†

You'll then find a section with my skills. Nothing fancy here, just a list of skills with discrete animations.

#### About Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The about me section references my academic and career path, and also my resume. You can download it by clicking on the button.

#### Contact üìß

The contact section is a simple form that allows you to send me a message.

### PhotoPortfolio

<img src="./res/photo_portfolio.png">

This portfolio is a showcase of my work as a photographer. It includes my setup, my 3D models, and my albums.

#### Setup üì∑

The setup section is a list of the equipment I use to take my photos. I used Three.js to render the 3D model of my camera. (Fancy, right ? :D)
